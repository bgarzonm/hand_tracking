# hand_tracking

This project uses OpenCV to detect and track human hand movements in real-time using computer vision techniques. The project uses a webcam to capture video frames, and then applies image processing algorithms to identify the location and movement of hands within the video stream. The hand tracking system can be used for a variety of applications, including gesture recognition, sign language translation, and virtual reality interfaces.
